          <p>
            I'm Cameron Kozlin, a second year Computer Science major at the University of Florida with a minor in Spanish. 
            As of Summer 2020, I have a 3.94 cumulative Grade Point Average on a 4-point scale.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoy Gator football, Star Wars, crosswords, coding, and podcasts. 
            My Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/CameronKozlin" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="link">@CameronKozlin</a>,
            is pretty much an amalgamation of those five things,
            so if you share these interests, or want to learn more about me, feel free to check it out!
          </p>
            <p>
            Right now, my favorite programming language is C++,
            because of its versatility and the beauty of pointers. However, I am always practicing new ones, and willing to learn whatever languages
            are best suited to approach the problem at hand.
            </p>
            <p>
            At the moment I am mostly focused on backend development. Mastering data structures, algorithm design, and object-oriented 
            programming
            is my highest priority. As a result, this website is not the most beautiful portfolio. It is more of an online résumé where I can be a little less formal
            and a little more myself. That said, I am always ready for a challenge and excited to learn new things, and plan to make this site a masterpiece once I turn my attention to the front-end.
            </p>
          <p>
            My goal is to contribute to software that others around the world
            can use and enjoy. I take pride in anything I do, and find the thought of software that I am a part of adding convenience and enjoyment to others' lives
            inspiring. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe that my experience, combined with a passion for learning and creating in the field of technology will help me to thrive in any position.
            Thanks for visiting my online portfolio. Enjoy your stay!
